steps.
1. include on page
2. call the function with an element or nodelist passed in: `setAbsolute(document.querySelectorAll('.item'))`
3. all elements are now set absolute and should be in their same position

Note that this removes margins - this is because the position would be offset by the margins if they were left on and the element was made absolutely positioned.
